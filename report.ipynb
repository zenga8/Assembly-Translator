    "## What did/do you find frustrating about this assignment? (inward)\n",
    "I found it frustrating to recall certain fundamental aspects of low-level programming needed to fully understand key parts of the lab. For example, it was difficult for me to understand when you should use words instead of blocks for certain memory allocations. I was most frustrated during the translations of function calls because I found the use of the stack between the different parts of the program hard to understand.\n",

    "If I were the instructor, I would commend us on finishing the work we were able to, and for the implementations we could not complete but still reported on. I would encourage next steps to be to ask for more assistance earlier on in the lab to we can get the knowledge we need to be able to complete the lab sooner.\n",

    "### How much did you know about the subject before we started? (backward)\n",
    "In terms of assembly, I learned the basics of it from 2DA4. We learned about ARM and used programs like Quartus to run it. However, there was a lot of basic concepts I forgot about and had to refresh myself on them through Google and previous textbooks. I did not recall learning much of the Visitor design pattern so I also had to research it. I was familiar with trees in 2C03 so that part of the lab I had some understanding of when looking at the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What did/do you find frustrating about this assignment? (inward)\n",
    "Relearning assembly was a big part that frustrated me as it took a lot of my lab time to understand it (e.g., the addressing modes, the formatting of assembly code, ARM vs. PEP/9, etc.). Also, while wanting to improve on this, I found it difficult to work on this lab incrementally between the 4-week time given to us because of other commitments from other classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### If you were the instructor, what comments would you make about this piece? (outward)\n",
    "I would appreciate the organization of the report as well as the code. Though, for the code, I would point out that it could always continued to be better organized and also that some parts of implementation (implementation code from F4 and F5 is incomplete) and would look at the report for why this is the case, encouraging to try implementing even if it is incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What would you change if you had a chance to do this assignment over again? (forward)\n",
    "If I had a chance to redo this assignnent, I would like to take more time to relearn assembly and ask the TA for clarification on any tasks I was unsure about. I would also try to work on the lab incrementally, as purposed by the lab since we had 4 weeks to work on it. Also, I would, even if incorrect, try to implements F4 and F5 and then try to get help about why my code is not working and receive feedback on it from the TA/professor/online."
